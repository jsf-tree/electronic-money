Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions
to perform computations. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class
objects, which means that they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as
values from functions, and assigned to variables.

Functional programming also emphasizes immutability and avoiding side effects, which
means that functions should not modify their arguments or have any other effects beyond
returning a value.

In Python, you can use functional programming concepts to write more expressive and
concise code. Here are some tips for using functional programming in Python:

1) Use lambda functions: Lambda functions are anonymous functions that can be defined
inline. They can be useful for writing short, one-off functions that don't need to
be named or reused.

2) Use list comprehensions: List comprehensions are a concise way to create new lists by
iterating over existing lists and applying a function to each element. They can be more
expressive and easier to read than traditional for loops.

3) Use higher-order functions: Python has many built-in higher-order functions, such as
map, filter, and reduce, that take functions as arguments and apply them to
sequences or other objects.

4) Avoid side effects: When writing functions, try to avoid modifying any arguments or
other objects outside the scope of the function. This can make your code more
predictable and easier to test.

5) Use recursion: Recursion is a common technique in functional programming that can be
used to solve many problems, such as traversing tree structures or searching for elements
in a list.

Here's an example of how you can use functional programming concepts to create a simple
program that calculates the sum of squares of even numbers in a list:
"""

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Use filter to get only even numbers
evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

# Use map to calculate the squares
squares = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, evens))

# Use reduce to calculate the sum
total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, squares)

print(total)

# This program uses lambda functions, filter, map, and reduce to perform the required
# operations. It also avoids side effects by creating new lists for the filtered and mapped
# values, rather than modifying the original list.
